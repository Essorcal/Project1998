/// Mentorship — the <b>Mentor</b> ability (Spells.csv 106, taught by every path's trainer at level 40) and
/// the tally the <b>Poet Moon armor</b> chain counts. Ported from RTK <c>Spells/common/mentor.lua</c>.
///
/// <para><b>Two casts, one relationship.</b> Cast it near a player between the 3rd and 8th insight who has
/// never been mentored and has no mentor, and they get an accept/decline prompt; accept and they are your
/// protégé. Cast it near that same protégé once they reach the 15th insight and the mentorship culminates:
/// your tally rises by one, they keep a permanent "Mentored by …" mark, and both of you are free again.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why it is repaired rather than transcribed.</b> RTK's own script is broken here: its
/// culmination branch sits INSIDE <c>if target.level &lt; 3 or target.level &gt; 8</c> and then tests
/// <c>target.level &gt;= 15</c>, so the two arms of its own conditional contradict each other and the
/// offer path is unreachable for exactly the levels it advertises. The dialogue it speaks states the rule
/// plainly — <i>"as long as they have reached the 3rd insight and have not exceeded the 8th … you may
/// culminate the mentorship when the mentoree has reached the 15th"</i> — and per this project's standing
/// rule, when RTK's strings and RTK's logic disagree the strings are the better witness. The strings are
/// implemented.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The mentor is remembered by NAME</b>, not by the transient session id RTK stores, so a
/// mentorship survives both parties logging out — it has to, since it spans a dozen levels of the
/// protégé's growth.</para>
///
/// <para><b>No karma penalty.</b> nexusatlas warns that the Poet Moon step "could bring you to dramatically
/// low karma (Snake!) if you are not careful", but nothing in it or in RTK says the cast itself docks
/// karma, and the likeliest reading is the obvious one — shepherding a level-3 through twelve insights
/// means hunting far below your own, which is where the karma goes. Inventing a debit here would be
/// guessing, so there is none.</para>
