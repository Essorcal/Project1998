/// (<c>ctx</c>) plus a data row (the "row" half of the verb/row model). Both spells (<see cref="SpellScript"/>)
/// and item use-effects (<see cref="ItemScript"/>) are just instances of this over different verb files and
/// facade types — one engine, no duplicated MoonSharp plumbing.
///
/// Safety: the script runs under MoonSharp's hard sandbox (no io/os/file access), and every verb call is wrapped
/// so a Lua error is logged — with the script location and the stack — and reported as
/// <see cref="VerbResult.Errored"/>, distinct from <see cref="VerbResult.Missing"/>, rather than crashing the
/// caller. A MoonSharp <see cref="Script"/> is not thread-safe, so calls are serialized under a lock (fine —
/// casts/item-uses are low-frequency vs movement/IO).
///
/// The facade type(s) a host will pass as <c>ctx</c> must be registered with MoonSharp
/// (<c>UserData.RegisterType&lt;T&gt;()</c>) before the first <see cref="Invoke"/>; the static wrapper classes do
