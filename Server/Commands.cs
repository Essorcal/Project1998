/// WHY A TABLE. This used to be ~70 <c>text.StartsWith(...)</c> lines in HandleChat, each embedding the
/// prefix as a literal (as did every usage string and comment that named a command — some 500 mentions in
/// all, which is what made changing the prefix a research project). Worse, ORDER was load-bearing: the
/// plural item lister had to be tested before the singular item granter, the mail-flag probe before the
/// mailbox, the spellbook before the one-letter status probe — otherwise the shorter name swallowed the
/// longer one, and adding a command whose name was a prefix of another silently broke that other one.
/// Exact-name lookup removes that whole class of bug, and <see cref="Prefix"/> makes the prefix itself a
/// one-character change.
///
/// CONTRACT: a handler receives the ARGUMENT TAIL — the message with the prefix, the command name and the
/// separating space already removed, then trimmed. "@item Fine Sword 3" reaches GiveItemCmd as
/// "Fine Sword 3". Handlers must not re-parse the command name out of it.

    // Session.GmCommands.cs alone, so @lvl popped a modal, @item made the character speak, and @clip
    // printed in the status pane. They are not interchangeable:
    //
    //   0x02  SendMessage   the LOGIN message box. It does not stack: a second line REPLACES the first, so
    //                       multi-line output silently becomes one line. It is the pre-world channel (see
    //                       Session.Dialog.cs) and no command answers on it.
    //   0x0D  SendLog       self-speech. A bubble over your own character plus a chat-pane line — loud, and
    //                       clamped at 250 characters (@dog's reply was being cut mid-word).
    //   0x0A  SendMiniText  the status / mini-text pane under the inventory: where the game already puts
    //                       "experience gained", look-at names and pickup lines, and where RTK's own scripts
    //                       put cast confirmations, cooldowns and refusals alike (clif_sendminitext — see

    //
    //   readout       a report you asked for: a listing, a dump, a value read back,
    //                 or the help a bare command prints.                                Reply  -> status pane
    //   confirmation  a line stating what the command changed.                          Reply  -> status pane
    //   refusal       the command's action did NOT happen: bad arguments, no such       Refuse -> speech bubble
    //                 target, a state or a shape that forbids it.
    //
    // Readouts and confirmations take the status pane because it is where the rest of this server already
    // answers, and because it is the only one of the three that survives a twenty-line listing intact.
    // Refusals take the bubble precisely BECAUSE it is loud and in the way: a refusal that scrolls quietly
    // past in the status pane is indistinguishable from a command that ran and did nothing, which is the
    // confusion this tooling exists to prevent.
