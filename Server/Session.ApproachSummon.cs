///
/// <para><b>Nothing here is a new path.</b> Each member wraps one the server already runs, so a spell and the
/// GM command it mirrors cannot drift apart: the lookup is whisper's and the commands' (<c>FindPlayer</c>), the
/// target slot is the one <see cref="LuaResolvePcTarget"/> fills, and both moves are
/// <c>EnterMap(..., ArrivalPolicy.AdjacentFreeElseStack)</c> with the same arguments
/// <c>ApproachCmd</c> and <c>BringCmd</c> pass (Session.GmCommands.cs). The verbs in spell_verbs.lua own every
/// guard and every line the player reads; these do the engine work.</para>

/// <see cref="LuaSummonTarget"/> takes the target's monitor (row 2 of docs/common/Locking.md, a second session

/// (row 3) inside it and releases it before returning. That is <c>@bring</c>'s sequence, with the Lua gate
/// outermost, which is also where the poet Resurrect family already moves another player from a spell verb
/// (<see cref="LuaReviveTarget"/> -&gt; <see cref="ReviveAt"/> -&gt; <c>EnterMap</c>). Before the move, Summon
/// ends the target's open exchange itself, with <c>EnterMap</c>'s own <c>EndTrade</c> call (which takes the
