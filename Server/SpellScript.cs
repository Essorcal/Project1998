    /// not re-run through C#" — but the two are NOT interchangeable on the way out, and treating them as

    /// notices. Folding both to false therefore left a broken spell completely silent — no effect, no
    /// message, nothing in the client at all — which reads to a player as the keypress being dropped. So the
