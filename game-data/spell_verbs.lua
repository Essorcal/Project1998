-- Spell verbs: the LOGIC half of the data-driven spell system (the "verb"; SpellParams.csv is the "row").
-- Each verb is a function(ctx, row):
--   ctx = the SpellContext facade -> engine primitives (ctx:spendMana / ctx:damage / ctx:heal / ...) plus
--         read-only caster stats (ctx.will, ctx.level, ctx.might, ctx.hp, ctx.hasTarget, ...).
--   row = this spell's SpellParams.csv row, numbers already parsed (row.coeff, row.mana, row.amount, ...);
--         empty CSV cells are nil, so `row.base or 0` gives a safe default.
-- Bind a verb to a spell by adding a SpellParams.csv row whose `verb` column names it.
-- Edit THIS file or the CSV and run !reload to see changes live -- no server restart.

-- =========================================================================================================
-- ARCHETYPE verbs (arch_*): the DEFAULT behaviour for a whole spell archetype, run for every spell of that
-- archetype (see Session.ApplyCast). The engine has already evaluated the spell's real formula and mana cost
-- from spell_effects.csv, so these read ctx.amount / ctx.mana rather than per-spell row params. A missing
-- arch_* verb makes that archetype fall back to its C# handler, so migration is one archetype at a time.
-- =========================================================================================================

-- Damage archetype: the standard direct magic attack. ctx:magicDamage does the whole sequence (mana check ->
-- resolve target -> spend mana -> deflect roll -> apply + XP). A DEFLECT still costs the mana: the spell was
-- cast, the target resisted it. Returns false only if the cast couldn't happen at all (no mana / no target),
-- so the cast animation is suppressed for those and those only.
function verbs.arch_damage(ctx, row)
  return ctx:magicDamage(ctx.amount, ctx.mana)

-- Heal archetype: restore the caster's own HP by the engine-evaluated amount (spell_effects.csv formula).
-- Mana is checked+spent first (return false on short mana so the cast animation is suppressed, matching C#);
-- ctx:heal caps at max HP and plays the sparkle/message.

-- already cast that spell." off its own `target.paralyzed`, static.lua answers "A more powerful spell is in
-- effect." off the very same flag -- and the only reason it had to hand-write the choice per script is that a
-- mob stored one boolean per mechanic, never the identity of whatever set it. Our slots carry the spell key,
-- so the choice is made once, here. A protection keeps its own more specific line: that isn't a same-type
-- collision, it's the target being immune, and it can never be the spell you just cast.

-- BUFF EXCLUSIVITY SLOTS -- RTK Spells/spellTables.lua, verbatim. Buffs were the ONE family that skipped the
-- checkIfCast guard every other status obeys: arch_buff only cleared its own key and re-applied, so Might was
-- spammable and, worse, Might + Spirit Strength (same slot in RTK, different keys) STACKED into +6 might. RTK
-- itself is inconsistent about which half of that it fixes -- rogue/might.lua refuses on checkIfCast(mights)
-- while mage/might.lua calls removeDuras(mights) and refreshes -- so the refusal wins for both, matching the
-- rest of this file and the player-visible rule "one spell of a type at a time".
--
-- Only the four slots whose members actually reach arch_buff / arch_targetbuff are listed. The rest of RTK's
-- tables (furies, invis, morphs, backstabs, flanks, enchants) belong to spells that Session.ApplyCast
-- intercepts BEFORE the archetype dispatch and that already own a dedicated timer slot with its own guard.
-- Cross-slot blocking (BLOCKS, further down) doesn't apply here: RTK gives none of these a cross-guard, so a
-- Might and a Bless deliberately still stack -- they're different slots.
--
-- The export ALREADY carries this for 17 of them, in spell_effects.csv's `cureCat` column: the extractor read
-- the list argument of RTK's `removeDuras(mights)` and wrote it there, and on a Buff row (which has nothing to
-- cure) that column can only mean the exclusivity slot -- so buff_slot() falls back to it. What the extractor
-- could NOT see is `checkIfCast(mights)`, the refusal half, which is why the whole rogue Might family and the

-- column and ctx.chance evaluates per cast. Everything else in RTK lands 100% of the time, which is why blind
-- could be held on a creature indefinitely and a curse never missed.
--
-- STATIC is the counter-example, and RTK has it backwards. static.lua carries no roll at all, yet the real
-- client table flags it SplCanFail=1 while paralyze_mage is SplCanFail=0 (Spells.csv) -- exactly inverted
-- from the scripts, so the original game failed statics and RTK dropped that and invented paralyze's roll
-- instead. Live measurement (2026-08-22), three samples: 19/96 at Will 18, 22/123 at Will 19, 19/111 at
-- Will 20 -- pooled 60/330 = 18.2% [95% CI 14.4-22.7%]. That kills RTK's 70+will*.2307 for this spell (it
-- predicts 74%, ~12 sigma out) and it kills the other candidate too: an 18% rate under the SplCanFail
-- RollDeflect staircase needs prot ~16, but every level<=25 mob sits at Protection 0-1 and Will <= 25, so
-- deflect gives them 100% (165 of 180), 90% (10) or 81% (1). The fail roll is CASTER-side.
--
-- WHAT THE DATA DOES NOT SHOW IS THE WILL SLOPE, and the column below is honest fiction on that axis. The
-- three samples span two Will points; they are homogeneous (chi2 0.26 on 2 df) and the fitted logistic slope
-- is -0.089 +/- 0.180 (z -0.49, pointing the WRONG way). That is not evidence against Will-dependence -- a
-- 1%/point slope moves the rate 2.0pp across Will 18-20 against a 5.4pp standard error, so this experiment
-- could never have seen it (z 0.37; it would take ~3000 casts per arm). `player.will` is therefore the
-- WORKING MODEL, chosen because it hits 18.2% dead-on at the measured Wills; flat 18% and 10+will/2 fit
-- equally well and disagree wildly at endgame (100% vs 18% vs 60% at Will 100). ONE sample at Will 40 --
-- ~40 casts -- separates them: `will` predicts 40%, flat predicts 18%, a 22pp gap. Until that exists this
-- cell is a fit to three points, not a law.
--
-- These numbers are OURS, not archive values: nothing in the scraped data or the Lua pins a rate for the
-- others. They are the balance surface for "an offensive status should sometimes just fail" -- edit and
-- @reload, no rebuild. A per-spell `chance` formula in spell_effects.csv always wins over the table.

-- Baekho's Cunning (RTK Spells/Subpaths/Baekho/baekhos_cunning.lua) — the showcase for COMPOSED verbs: a
-- single spell that is simultaneously a rage MULTIPLIER, a damage-REDUCTION (deduction), and positional
-- STANCE grants, plus a stateful tier machine. It fits NO single archetype; it just composes primitives.
-- Recast to climb Cunning 1->6, each tier stronger and far pricier; each cast supersedes the lesser furies
-- (ctx:rage overwrites the single rage slot). The tier TABLE is an RTK constant so it lives here in the verb.
-- CLASSIC (4.95-era) Cunning chart, from the Rogue Tutor Melalye "Baekho's Cunning" board post in the scraped
-- archive (canonical, > RTK per user). Per tier: mana, damage multiplier (rage), deduction (incoming-damage
-- mult), and cumulative special grants (Cun2 = Backstab, Cun3 adds Flank). ded goes 0/15/30/55/85% reduction
-- -> mult 1.00/0.85/0.70/0.45/0.15; at Cun4-5 this EXCEEDS Sanctuary's 50%, so casting Sanctuary DOWNGRADES a
-- high-Cunning rogue (Sanctuary overrides Cunning's slot; see ApplyCunningDeduction). The 6th cunning (~262k
-- mana) is "no better than the 5th" in the archive, so 5 is the real cap.
--
-- THE 55%/85% AT CUN4-5 CONFLICTS WITH NEXUS ATLAS, WHICH SAYS 45%/60%, and the board post wins. Both sources
-- are the SAME ERA -- identical mana and identical 4x-8x multipliers, and the 2004-05-05 archive news chart
-- still lists those multipliers, so nothing about this spell was rebalanced between them (the 6x/7x/9x/10x/12x
-- + 8/16/24/32/40% numbers in RTK and in the late Atlas mirror are the LATER rebalance, post-2004). Within one
-- era the tiebreak is method, not date: Melalye's post is a tutor's in-depth retest that opens by saying "many
-- previous charts were wrong in parts", and it states the reduction TWICE -- once as a chart and once as a
-- measured damage table (Cun1-5 = 100k/85k/70k/45k/15k taken against a fixed attacker), which is 0/15/30/55/85
-- read straight off the numbers, with named testers. The Atlas figure is a fan-site table with no method shown,
-- and is exactly the kind of "previous chart, wrong in parts" the post describes -- right in every column but
-- this one. Change it only if a DATED pre-2003 source turns up showing 45/60.
--
-- ONE 938s RUN, ARMED ONCE — same shape as Chung Ryong's Rage, and for the same reason: RTK's
-- baekhos_cunning.lua calls setDuration("baekhos_cunning", 938000) in its first-cast branch ONLY, and every
-- tier-up branch resets the AETHER and nothing else. A climb therefore inherits what REMAINS of the run.
--
-- THIS TABLE USED TO CARRY A PER-TIER `dur` (938000/788000/638000/488000/338000) taken from the archive chart,
-- re-armed fresh on every tier-up. Those five numbers are 938000 - 150000*(n-1), and 150000 is the aether:
-- the board post recorded the time REMAINING when each tier was reached in one fixed 938s run, climbing as
-- fast as the cooldown allows. It was a reading of RTK's model, not a contradiction of it. Re-arming them made
-- the run extendable without limit — climb slower than the aether and each tier opened a fresh window (cast at
-- t=0, climb at t=900 -> the run ends at 1688s instead of 938s, and so on up).
--
-- `msg` is again the CLIENT'S OWN text (Atlas npcsubpath 2003-08-22, and RTK's Lua agrees word for word):
-- the first cast reads differently and every climb after it repeats the same line. What was here before --
-- "Baekho sharpens your instincts (x5 damage)" -- was invented, and it printed ON TOP of the central
-- "You cast Baekho's cunning." because the verb never marked the cast narrated.
--
-- THE `four` COLUMN IS THE TIER-4 GRANT, and it was missing until Poet Tutor SkaDemon's "Rage and Cunning"
-- board post turned up naming what each tier actually GIVES you: "Fury / Backstab / Flank / 4 Way Attack /
-- Super Sanctuary". Cunning 4 opens the swing onto all four adjacent tiles at once, with no side roll.
-- Dalsichvedin's 2004-05-05 damage chart agrees from the other direction, listing targets per tier as
-- 1/2/3/4/4 -- and that 3 at Cunning 3 is only reachable if Flank is ONE side, which is exactly how
-- Session.SwingTargets rolls it. Tier 5's "Super Sanctuary" is the 85% deduction, not a targeting change,
-- so `four` simply stays on. (SkaDemon's mana column is rounded poet-facing guidance -- 4100/16000/42000/
-- 130000, "be ready to spire accordingly" -- so Melalye's measured minima below are kept.)

-- Venom (RTK mage/venom.lua & kin): a damage-over-time poison, on a CREATURE OR A PLAYER.
--
-- TWO SOURCES, and they agree once you do the arithmetic. Listed oldest first, which is also most-in-era:
--   tswolf.com, 2001-02-23 (4.83/4.95 era -- the closest source we have):
--     "Poisons Target for a Random amount of time. A Poisoned Person recieves a 160 second poison that will
--      bring them down to low health, but not kill them."
--   NexusAtlas, 2002-12 (later, but the only one that quotes a damage number):
--     "Poisons monster targets for a random amount of time. Does 1000 damage a second, disregarding armor
--      class, on other players. Does more damage per second to animals. Poison will not kill a target but
--      rather bring them to the lowest possible health."
--
-- So a CREATURE gets the random window; a PERSON gets a fixed 160s. 160s x 1000/s = 160,000 total against a
-- never-kill clamp, which means the rate only sets HOW FAST you reach the floor and tswolf's "brought down to
-- low health" is simply the steady state of sitting there. It is also self-scaling: anyone whose pool exceeds
-- ~160k rides the whole window out without ever flooring, so venom decides fights early and merely hurts at
-- cap -- no special case needed for level 99.
--
-- Neither target can ever take the killing blow: the tick is clamped to leave 1 vita and keeps flashing.
-- The creature half reuses the SAME poison engine the Rogue poison-dart trap drives (World.PoisonMob).
--
--   row.amount  per-tick cap, creature ("more damage per second to animals" -- MaxHp*1% per 1.5s tick)
--   row.base    random window lower bound, ms (creature)
--   row.duration        upper bound, ms -- RTK's usual 30000; Burn's window is a FIXED 75s (base = duration)
--   row.flat    > 0 swaps the creature's MaxHp*1% for a fixed per-tick amount (Burn alone works that way)
--   row.pcDps     PLAYER damage per SECOND -- atlas 1000 read as a rate => 1500/tick. UNVERIFIED.
--   row.pcPerTick PLAYER damage per TICK, overrides pcDps when set. The rival reading of the same
--                 sentence: 1000 PER TICK (=667/s), which is the shape RTK's own code uses (MaxHp*1%
--                 per 1500ms tick, capped 2000/tick -- and a typical 1% lands near 1000, so the
--                 description may just be someone eyeballing the per-tick number). Set it to 1000 to
--                 switch readings. Only the never-kill floor moves: ~160k max HP vs ~107k.
--   row.pcDurMs   PLAYER window, ms       -- tswolf 160000, fixed, overrides the random roll
--
-- Both player numbers are one @reload away from being retuned once someone measures them on a live server.

-- you wait (row.mana / row.duration), so one verb covers all of them.
-- Casting with nothing typed is a no-op that costs nothing -- RTK guards the same way, and the client shows
-- its own prompt, so there is nothing useful to say about it.
-- The Sage ladder's world channel. Bought a rung at a time from npcs.SageNpc (npc_dialog.lua), which owns
-- the price, the wait and the replacement rule; this owns what the spell actually DOES.
--
-- REACH IS THE WHOLE PRODUCT. Only the top rung sages everywhere. Below it the spell works in the "4.0
-- designated areas" (Mythic, Wilderness, KaMing's Encampment, carnage and events -- ctx:sageReach() == "sage"),
-- rungs 3-4 add the caster's own kingdom ("home"), and ANYWHERE ELSE THE CAST DOES NOT FAIL: it becomes the
-- Mentor spell. That is not an inference. The Dream Weaver that introduced the rule says so outright --
-- "In the towns, your Sage spells will no longer broadcast your thoughts to the Kingdom. However, you will
-- now be able to use these spells to allow your wisdom to flow to those new to the Nexus. Indeed, the spells
-- Champion, Prince Charming, Sage, and Hierophant will operate identically to the spell Mentor when you are
-- in one of the towns of the Nexus." (Eldridge, "Sage in towns") -- and tswolf repeats it per spell, "Has
-- same effect as ""Mentor"" when casted in a NON Sage Area".
--
-- THE AETHER BURNS EITHER WAY, deliberately: a player asked for exactly that to be changed and was refused --
-- "block sage and mentor spell usage in non-saging areas instead of casting Aethers (Won't be changed. Was
-- written to be like that)". So the mana and the cooldown are charged on the Mentor branch too. Do not
-- "fix" this into a free cast; it is the documented behaviour and it is why rung 5 is worth 500,000 gold.
--
-- The client prompts for the wisdom text before the server ever sees the cast (Spells.csv SplQuestion ">"),
-- so on the Mentor branch the player types their line and THEN gets Mentor's own "Who would you like to
-- mentor?" prompt. Slightly odd, and faithful: the typed text is simply not used.
--
-- See docs/common/Deferred-Work.md and Sources.csv `atlas-2002-12-25-sage`. Still not modelled: rungs 3-4

-- cost all differ by family (ctx.sacrificeFamily); Baekho's Rage adds x1.5 to the warrior pair.
--
-- OVERKILL — the damage the killing blow did not need — is spent differently by class, and BOTH mechanisms
-- are ERA-GATED OFF at our 2001-07-09 target date, because both were added to the live game years later:
--   * ctx:overflow  warrior, 2007-04-10 — splashes it onto the tiles around the TARGET (era warrior_overflow)
--   * ctx:backflow  rogue,   2008-09-18 — refunds it to the caster as vita+mana  (era rogue_overkill)
-- Both primitives self-gate in C# (Session.LuaOverflow / LuaBackflow), so calling them unconditionally here
-- is correct: at an era that has them they fire, otherwise they are no-ops and the strike is a plain one-tile
-- hit. Do NOT add an era check here — the gate is deliberately not script-liftable. See Server/Era.cs.
--
-- ORDER: the strike's own HP/MP cost is charged BEFORE the refund. The rogue-board doc's arithmetic only
-- works this way round (LS takes 50% vita then overkill refills 50%; DA zeroes mana then overkill refills to
-- half). Refunding first — which this used to do — halved LS's refund and wiped DA's mana refund entirely.
--
-- NOTE: casting at empty air still spends the mana + arms the cooldown (RTK), but costs no HP (nothing landed).

-- (applied by the engine's regen tick, which is why the TIER is recorded in C# rather than kept here).
--
-- THE WINDOW IS FIXED AND IT IS SET ONCE. RTK's chung_ryongs_rage.lua arms `setDuration(..., 938000)` in its
-- first-cast branch ONLY; every tier-up branch resets the AETHER (`setAether`, the 120s recast gate) and
-- nothing else. So one run is 938s no matter how you climb it: 120s per step means tier 6 lands at t=600s and
-- you hold it for the remaining ~5.6 minutes, then it wears out and takes its vita. Renewing does NOT extend
-- the run — the fury always ends in the drain, which is the whole shape of the spell. That is why the climb
-- passes durMs = 0 below (the engine reads it as "keep the deadline you already have").
--
-- The 938000 could not come from spell_effects.csv: the RTK export only ever captured durations that lived in
-- a TABLE, and this one is a `local duration` inside the script — the same class of drop as the in-script
-- spell costs. It sat at a made-up 135000 (barely longer than the aether, so the climb was nearly impossible)
